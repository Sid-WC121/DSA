<h1 align="center"> Hash Table</h1>
<br>

<p> A hash table is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values.In a hash table, data is stored in an array format where each data has a unique index value.Accessing the data becomes very fast if we knows the index.The efficiency of the mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.<p>
  
- #### It works by taking in a key and using a hash function to calculate an index in an array at which the corresponding value is stored.

<p><em>A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.</em></p>

- **Max Heap:** In a max heap, the root node must be the largest among all other nodes in the heap, and every node must be greater than or equal to its children.
- **Min Heap:** In a min heap, the root node must be the smallest among all other nodes in the heap, and every node must be less than or equal to its children.

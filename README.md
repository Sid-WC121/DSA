<h2> :sparkle: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms </h2>
<p> Data structures and algorithms are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They are the foundation upon which we build programs to solve problems. </p>
<p> Data structures are the way we organize data in our programs. Algorithms are the steps we take to manipulate that data. </p>

<h2> :sparkle: Introduction to Graph </h2>
<p> A graph is a mathematical representation of a set of objects and the connections or relationships between them. It consists of two main components: vertices (also known as nodes) and edges. It a non-linear data structure <p>
<h2 align="center">graph = nodes + edges</h2>

- Vertices represents the entities, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes.
- Edges represents the relationship between the entities. An edge can be directed or undirected. 

<p> Mathematicaly we can also say that a graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and set E of edges <p>
<h2 align="center"> G = ( V, E ) </h2>
<p> In computer science, graphs are commonly used in data structures, such as trees and networks, and in algorithms, such as search algorithms and pathfinding algorithms. They are also used in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2>:pirate_flag: Types of Graph </h2>

<h2>:one: Undirected Graph </h2>
<p> It is a graph <b> G </b> in which the edges does'nt have any direction.<br></p>

<h2>:two: Directed Graph </h2>
<p> It can be directed or undirected graph <b> G </b> in which the edges possess direction.<br></p>

<h2>:three: Weighted Graph </h2>
<p> It is a graph <b> G </b>edges have a numerical value(weight).</p>
  
  - <h4>Weighted Directed Graph: <em>A directed graph with edge weight</em> or <em>A weighted and directed graph is where edges have a direction and a numerical value!</em></h4>
